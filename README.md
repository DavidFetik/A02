Git/Webstorm/Github/Tutorial
If Using WebStorm...
* Step 1: Download **'Git'** ((https://git-scm.com/downloads). 
* Step 2: Create a **'GitHub'** Account (https://github.com/).
* Step 3: Once logged in, create a new **'repository'** by clicking the '+' button at the top right or the green 'New' button near the top left and fill in the required information. 
* Step 4: At this point you need to download WebStorm (https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/, you may need to apply for a student license prior to use or use a free trial). On GitHub start **'cloning'** the repository by clicking on the green 'Code'. Copy the HTTPS link. On WebStorm click on 'Get from VCS' and then paste the repository link. Make sure that the Version Control selected is Git. 
* Step 5: Make changes to the files within the local repository or create files. Once done, click on the 'Commit' tab on the left hand side. **'Commit'** your changes (including a message giving a brief explanation) by clicking the blue 'Commit' button and then **'push'** the changes to the **'remote'** repository on GitHub.  
* Step 6: When working with a team, you may need to create a **'branch'** of the main project and create a **'pull'** request. To create a branch on GitHub, go to the repository your team is collaborating on, clone it, and click on the gray 'main' button. 
* Step 7: Repeat Step 5 and then **'merge'** your created branch with the main branch. 
* Step 8: Create a pull request to request that your changes/contribution be added to the repository you cloned. "Pull" is a combination of merge and **'fetch'**. 
* Step 9: Sometimes there might be issues when merging branches, creating a **'merge conflict'**. This can occur when multiple branches have the same exact change, if the branch you're trying to merge into has been deleted or has had its name changed, etc. GitHub displays where the conflict is so it's easy to resolve. 
* Step 10: Once the conflict has been resolved, mark it as such and commit. You can then choose to delete your created branch. 

GLOSSARY
* Branch: An independent line of development. Used to create a copy of the code for editing purposes so that nothing catastrophic happens to the main code. 
* Clone: Creating a local copy of something (a repository in this case).
* Commit: Save
* Fetch: Copies changes into your local repository (from GitHub).
* GIT: A version control software that helps manage and track code changes. 
* GitHub: A centralized hub that allows for easy collaboration on coding projects. 
* Merge: To combine changes from different branches. 
* Merge Conflict: When conflicting changes are made to the same part of a file and Git is unable to resolve these changes on its own. 
* Push: Sends file changes made to a remote repository. 
* Pull: Gets changes from a remote repository and automatically merges those changes with your main branch. 
* Remote: Something hosted on an external server and not on your local computer. 
* Repository: Essentially a container for all project elements; a folder that contains not only your project's files but the entire history of changes made to those files.
